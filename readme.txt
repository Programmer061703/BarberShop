The Barbershop program simulates a barber shop with a set number of barbers and customers by utilizing Semaphores and mutexes. It begins with the command line. The program accepts 2 command line arguments: sleepTime and numBarbers. After these inputs are provided, no more user input is needed. The program then calculates the number of waiting chairs based off the number of barbers multiplied by 2. Then the number of customers is calculated by taking the number of barbers + number of waiting chairs. Then the program initializes the waiting room and barber semaphores, then the waiting room and barber mutexes.
